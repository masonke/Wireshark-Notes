|     | Data for this flow has been acknowledged.

|     | The next sequence number is less than or equal to the last-seen acknowledgement number. | We have more than two duplicate ACKs in the reverse direction. | The next expected sequence number and the next sequence number differ. |     |
|     |     | The current sequence number equals the next expected acknowledgement number. | "The last segment arrived within the Out-Of-Order RTT threshold. The threshold is either the value shown in the “iRTT” (tcp.analysis.initial_rtt) field under “SEQ/ACK analysis” if it is present.<br>If not present, the default value of 3ms is used.**" |     |
|     | Note: If the ACK didn't make it to the server, this isn't really a Spurious Retransmission - it's just a standard Retransmission. On the sender side, Wireshark must mark it as a Spurious Retransmission because the ACK was seen in the trace | We saw the last acknowledgement less than 20ms ago. |     |     |
